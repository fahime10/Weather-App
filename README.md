# Weather-App
Project from The Odin Project.
This project uses two APIs, the weather api, "https://api.weatherapi.com/", and the giphy API, "https://api.giphy.com".
The weather api is used for retrieving the weather information in real time and then displaying it for the user.
The giphy api is used to demonstrate in a fun way what it feels like with the temperature that is given by the weather api.

The user is required to input their city to find out the temperature, or they can input their country, which will point to the capital of that country.
